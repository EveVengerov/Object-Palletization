# Object-Palletization

Below is a brief demonstration of a robot arm identifying and tracking position of the object, picking it up and placing it inside the station marked by a smaller rectangle corner

This is a simple demonstration, next we will identify multiple objects as targets and choosing one which is the closest to the current robot position and picking each of the objects one by one until all are placed inside the station.
